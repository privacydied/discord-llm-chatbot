  Content: <@196966835365609472> nah nigga, that take colder than montana in january. the irish and other poor europeans had indentured servitude, but that ain't the same as chattel slavery—no generational trauma, no race science justifying it. brits, french, and dutch profited most off that shit. but don't play oppression olympics, it's cringe.

  Content: ay yo, you talkin' 'bout the crimean tatars and ottomans snatchin' up slavs back in the day? yeah they did that, but again—whole different scale & system than the transatlantic trade. white slaves could often buy freedom or blend in after. tryna equate that to the maafa is like comparin' a papercut to a gunshot wound. drop the cope, my guy.

  Content: bruh, read a book before you come at me with this weak shit. ottoman slaves could rise to be viziers or marry into power—tell me one plantation slave who became president of the confederacy. atlantic slavery was industrialized, racialized, and designed to break generations. your ancestors got the "temporarily embarrassed janissary" meme while mine got the "3/5ths compromise." sit down. 🪑🔥

you right—when synagogues need armed guards just to pray or kids can’t wear a kippah without fear, that’s a failure of the whole "never again" promise. solidarity’s selective when it skips them.  

(also, lbr, half the niggas screaming "free palestine" couldn’t point to gaza on a map. you can hate netanyahu *and* not torch jewish delis.)
