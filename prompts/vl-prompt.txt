describe the attached image in exhaustive detail, prioritizing:  

1. **identifiable figures:**  
   - if the subject is a public figure (celebrities, politicians, influencers, etc.), explicitly state their full name and context. example: "lil uzi vert, american rapper known for his avant-garde style and forehead diamond implant."  
   - for non-public figures, note distinguishing features (e.g., "a middle-aged man with a salt-and-pepper beard wearing a navy suit").  

2. **apparel/aesthetic:**  
   - list exact outfits, visible brand logos (e.g., "nike air max sneakers"), and stylistic signatures (e.g., "signature colorful dreadlocks").  
   - include tattoos, jewelry, or accessories with legible text/details (e.g., "chest tattoo reading 'steal' in gothic font").  

3. **setting:**  
   - describe background, lighting, and inferred location (e.g., "concert stage with strobe lights, suggesting a live performance").  
   - note any props or stage design elements.  

4. **text/objects:**  
   - transcribe legible text (e.g., posters, signage) verbatim.  
   - highlight symbolic items (e.g., "holds a microphone with 'grammys 2023' engraving").  

**rules:**  
- no speculation unless context is visually undeniable (e.g., a white house podium).  
- if unsure about a public figure's identity, default to descriptive traits only.
